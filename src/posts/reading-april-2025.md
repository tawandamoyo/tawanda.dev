Here's what I am reading this month, April 2025:

**The Histories** by Herodotus.
    I read The Histories a year or so ago but I find myself drawn back to the world's oldest history book. There is something there in the stories of long dead kings and generals, forgotten empires, and old myths that I find myself thinking about long after reading. I suspect part of it is the commonality of some aspects of human life - love, power, hate, treachery, revenge, regret, feuds - that has hardly changed in 2500 years.

**Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time** by James Suzman. 
    Have been reading this book for some months. I pick it up and put it down again, and then return once more, and repeat. It's a book about the history of work, and how humans have been shaped by it, especially after the advent of agriculture. It makes interesting reading now in the AI age, where machines threaten to take over all jobs. What, then, shall become of work, and us?

**AI Engineering** by Chip Huyen. 
    AI has taken the world by storm, and I thought I might as well learn a thing or two about AI Engineering. Slowly going through this book and learning a lot.
